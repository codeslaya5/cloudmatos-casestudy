# Remediation Case Study
## Remediation Use Case Problem Statement
EKS control plane logging is enabled for your Amazon EKS clusters

## Why remediation?
By default, cluster control plane logs aren't sent to CloudWatch Logs. Hence, we must enable each log type individually to provide audit and diagnostic logs directly from the Amazon EKS control plane to CloudWatch Logs. These logs can help you to secure and efficiently run your EKS clusters. You can select the exact log types you need, and the logging data is sent as log streams to the AWS CloudWatch log group created for the specified Amazon EKS cluster.
